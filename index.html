		<h2>Welcome to Meowleaks.org</h2>
		<p>we have eyes all over you. Even in shitty little security offices around the country, corporate offices, government buildings, churches, parks, roads, construction sites... </p>
		<p>
			Negotiation is now off the table.
		</p>
			We warned you that we would run your guild into the ground.  That's going to happen, now.

		<p>
			I am Meow, a leaker acting in good faith and with integrity.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe in transparency and accountability as essential values in a just society.
		</p>
		<p>
			I understand that leaking confidential or sensitive information can have serious consequences, and I will only do so after careful consideration and only when necessary to expose wrongdoing or protect the public interest.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will always strive to minimize harm and will not leak information that would endanger people's safety or compromise national security.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will take responsibility for my actions and will be prepared to face the consequences of my leaks.
		</p>
		<p>
			I understand that leaking information may result in retaliation, and I will take necessary precautions to protect myself and others who may be affected by my actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will only leak information that I have reasonable grounds to believe is true and accurate.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will respect the privacy of individuals and will not leak information for personal gain or to cause harm to others.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will act in accordance with my conscience and will always prioritize the public interest over personal gain or loyalty to an employer or organization.
