	<p>Rekz is the stalwart tank of the Meow Meow Kitties. His ability to soak up damage and hold the attention of multiple enemies at once has been instrumental in the guild's success.

	<p>RB is a skilled marksman who takes great pleasure in taking down difficult enemies from afar. His trusty pet, a fierce raptor named Razorclaw, is a constant companion on his many hunting expeditions.

	<h2 id="nat">Nat</h2>

Despite being known for his tendency to "pad" his damage meters, Nat's dedication to his guildmates and his willingness to put himself in harm's way have earned him the respect of his peers. Outside of raiding, Nat is a devout follower of the Light and spends much of his time in prayer and meditation.</p>

	<h2 id="turbo">Turbo</h2>

His quick wit and playful demeanor make him a popular member of the guild, and his love of pranks and mischief often keeps his guildmates on their toes.
